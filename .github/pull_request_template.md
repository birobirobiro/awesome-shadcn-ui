**Important Notes:**  
1. If you are introducing a new section, you must also add it to the `README.md` file and update the table of contents accordingly.  
2. This repository focuses on open-source and freely accessible projects. Paid or fully commercial resources will not be accepted.  

Just a heads-up: no need to add a date — our system takes care of that automatically!  

**Also:** Don't worry about formatting — our GitHub Action will automatically format the table and make sure everything stays in a single line per entry.

**Format your entry like this:**

```markdown
| Name | Description | [Link](Your_Link_Here) |
```
